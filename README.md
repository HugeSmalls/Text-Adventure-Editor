Create Your Own Adventure!

This is your game, like a storybook where players pick what happens next. Here’s how to make it:

Change the Start: Click in the "Starting Story" box and type the beginning of your adventure. Scroll if you write a lot!
Edit Story Pages: Click in the table boxes to change the story. Scroll for long text. Each row is a part of your game:
Page Number: A number for each part (like 1, 2, 3). Make each one different.
Story Text: What’s happening, like "You find a locked chest!"
Choice 1, 2, 3: What the player can do, like "Open the chest" or "Walk away." Leave blank if you don’t need all three.
Next Page 1, 2, 3: The number of the page each choice goes to.
Add More Pages: Click "Add New Page" to make a new row in the table. Fill it with your story details.
Test It: Click "Play Game" to try your game. You can go back to edit anytime.
Save Your Game: Click "Download Game" to save your game with the editor. Click "Remove Edit Option" to save just the game without editing tools.
Tip: Look at the example in the table to get ideas. You can make a space adventure, a haunted house, or anything you want!
